## What You Can Do

### 🥽 AR Guide
Import MusicXML files and get spatial practice guidance on Vision Pro (dual-staff notation + left/right hand key highlighting).

### 🎹 AI Duet (Relay Improvisation)
You play a phrase, the AI responds with its own, in an immersive space (supports automatic local backend discovery).

Optional: Enable AI Duet (local backend)
1. Start the local server: `rtk ./piano_duet_server/scripts/run_server.sh` (default `0.0.0.0:8766` for LAN access)
2. Make sure the AVP device and the backend are on the **same local network**
3. Allow **Local Network** permission on the AVP device (otherwise Bonjour auto-discovery will show as denied)

## Releases

- The repo is primarily source-code based: **requires local Xcode build** — no pre-built notarized app is provided.
